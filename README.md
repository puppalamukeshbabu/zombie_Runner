## Overview

**Zombie Runner** is a fast-paced 3D endless survival-horror runner combining high-speed lane-based traversal with responsive real-time combat, dynamic horror audio, and cinematic nocturnal visuals. Players sprint through apocalyptic city ruins and subterranean railway service tunnels, vaulting obstacles, sliding under barriers, scavenging ammunition and gold, and neutralizing aggressive undead threats.

## Features

- **Endless City & Subterranean Tunnel Environments:** Dynamically streamed 30m modular environment segments recycling seamlessly with smooth atmospheric fog, trilight ambient bounce, and cinematic lighting transitions.
- **Zombie Enemies & AI:** Multiple distinct zombie archetypes (Common Runner, Fast Sprinter, and Heavy Brute) featuring dynamic lane-aware pursuit, melee attack lunges, damage reaction flinches, and death states.
- **Weapon-Based Combat & Hit Detection:** Responsive raycast shooting controller with visual kickback recoil, dynamic auto-aim tracking, illuminated bullet tracers, and pooled blood/impact VFX.
- **Player Movement, Jumping & Sliding:** Responsive three-lane runner controller supporting instant lane shifting, grounded jump physics, low slide clearance under obstacles, and keyboard/mouse controls.
- **Coins, Ammunition & Scoring:** Real-time distance tracking and kill scoring, persistent PlayerPrefs high-score saving with record celebration, and collectible gold coins, ammo boxes, and health packs.
- **Health & Revive System:** Player health management with damage feedback, invulnerability frames, shield protection, and a one-time revive mechanic per run.
- **Cinematic Horror Atmosphere & Rain Mode Variant:** Cool-blue moonlight, warm sodium emergency lighting, volumetric linear fog, ACES tonemapping, and dynamic post-processing. Includes a dedicated **Rain Mode Environment Variant** featuring high-density particle rainfall, stretched rain streaks, wet reflective road and obstacle materials, subtle standing water puddles, atmospheric storm mist, continuous rain ambience audio, and dynamic subway tunnel occlusion.
- **Layered Horror Audio & Dynamic Music:** 4-layer adaptive horror soundtrack crossfading across exploration, tension, combat, and critical health states, coupled with 3D spatialized positional zombie audio and tactile mechanical UI sound effects.
- **Main Menu & Settings:** Comprehensive title screen with survivor camera staging, audio volume persistence, graphics toggles, control reference guide, and seamless scene navigation.
- **Windows PC Support:** Fully tested on Windows PC with native keyboard/mouse controls and WASAPI/DirectSound multi-device audio routing.
